Blackâ€“Scholes Option Pricing with Machine Learning
Predicts European call and put option prices by combining the Blackâ€“Scholes formula with Random Forest Regression.
Generates synthetic option pricing data from financial theory and optimizes ML models for high accuracy.

Key Features
Synthetic data generation via Blackâ€“Scholes.

Separate ML models for Call & Put options.

RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Performance metrics: RÂ², MAE, RMSE.

Workflow
Generate synthetic option prices (S, K, T, r, Ïƒ).

Train Random Forest models for call & put options.

Tune parameters using RandomizedSearchCV (3-fold CV).

Retrain on full data & evaluate performance.

Achieve improved predictive accuracy over baseline.
